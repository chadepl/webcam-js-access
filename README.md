# Webcam JS Access

This repository shows a minimal working example of a Vite app that accesses the video/audio feeds from the device using JS.
It also showcases how to switch between different input devices like the built-in camara and the iPhone camera in a Mac.

To configure and run:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
